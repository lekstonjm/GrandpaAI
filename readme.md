MYPL 
This is a a set o tools build around the IA subject of automatic reasonning. This work has been motivated by the lecture of the book IA by Russel and Norvig. 
The code structuration is volontary academic oriented, entities have been structured in layer as of onion ring and the source folder namming reflect this vision.

This is the very basic basement build to sort out some common trap of c++ programming. Inside you can find the templated Ref  struct. The programme is build on it. I could use some standard implements but for academic purpose I choose to implement my own version. I added some specific stuf like cast assign and as function which give me some cool shortcut.
